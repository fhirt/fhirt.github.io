Hi there! I'm a DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation and collaboration. Over the years, I've gained experience working with a variety of software development and operations tools, and have honed my skills in areas such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), software engineering, and monitoring.

My goal is to ensure that our customers' systems run smoothly, and I aim to be proactive in detecting and preventing issues before they occur.
